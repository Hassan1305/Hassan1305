  <h1>💫 About Me:</h1>
</p>

  Hey there! I'm a Computer Science graduate and a passionate problem solver with a knack for tackling challenges from unique angles. Currently, I’m a full-time freelancer and also working part-time at Techflo as a Full Stack Developer.

My expertise spans across a broad range of technologies including JavaScript, Python, C#, Java, MySQL, .NET Framework, UWF, ASP.NET, and ReactJS. I'm particularly skilled in mobile development, utilizing React Native and Java to build robust mobile applications.

At Techflo, I focus on .NET web solutions, handling both front-end and back-end development to deliver comprehensive applications. On the side, I take on freelance projects, allowing me to continuously grow and apply my skills in diverse scenarios.

During my academic journey, I delved deep into Artificial Intelligence, exploring algorithms like Genetics, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, and Adversarial Search in game theory. I also worked with machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and K-means Clustering. My learning journey is ongoing, with a strong focus on Neural Networks, NLP, Computer Vision, and beyond.

I'm always excited about new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach out via email at ch.hasni.khan@gmail.com or connect with me here on LinkedIn.

Thanks for sticking with me on this journey!<br>
