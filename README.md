  <h1>💫 About Me:</h1>
</p>

  As a recent graduate deeply passionate about mobile development, I've specialized in React Native while also expanding my expertise with React for web applications and the MERN stack. My journey in technology extends into Python for data analytics and complex problem-solving. With a firm belief in continuous learning and self-improvement, especially in mental health, I've embraced the challenges of adapting and mastering new technologies rapidly. Beyond my core focus, I've gained proficiency in .NET, PHP, Python scripting, web scraping, and web design, and ventured into Android app development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, including work with neural networks. Passionate about leveraging technology for community benefit, I'm eager to collaborate on projects that make a meaningful impact.<br>
