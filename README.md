  <h1>💫 About Me:</h1>
</p>

  As an enthusiastic and passionate developer, I have gained experience primarily in React and React Native, while also working extensively with the MERN stack. My programming expertise extends to Python, where I've had the opportunity to explore data analytics and solve complex problems. Currently, I am an undergraduate student committed to continuous learning and expanding my skillset. My interests include mental health and self-improvement, as I believe that dedication and a growth mindset can help us achieve anything we set our minds to. Being a proud coder, I take pride in my ability to adapt and learn new technologies quickly. In addition to my core competencies, I have experience working with web tools such as .NET and PHP, and I'm proficient in Python scripting, web scraping, and web designing. Over the years, I've expanded my skills into the realm of Android development, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, where I've had the chance to work with neural networks. My passion for technology, combined with my eagerness to learn and grow, makes me a versatile and valuable member of any development team.<br>
